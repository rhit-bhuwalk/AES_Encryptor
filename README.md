# AES_Encryptor
This repository contains code to read a file and encrypt it using the AES encryption scheme. Additionally, users can input a positive integer and the program will nest AES encryptions on the message those many times

AES is a complicated encryption algorithm. Essentially, it takes in a message and a key. The key is used to generate a 44 by 4 key matrix, while the message is used to generate a 4 by 4 matrix. 

Using these 2 matrices, multiple operations are done on them to then finally generate the encrypted message.
